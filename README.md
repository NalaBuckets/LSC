# LSC
A place to store our code and data about local school councils 

## Project 1: Create an analytical data set about LSCs 

What will be in this data set
I've started summarizing below. My goal is to get as explicit as possible so we have specific variable names at the bottom level of each of these lists 

Identifiers:
- School ID number
- School Name

School Characteristics: 
- ES/ HS
- Enrollment

LSC Characteristics
- Elected vs appointed
- Traditional vs alternative composition

YEAR
- Year


Demographics
- Race
- Income


### Updates

DD added the file with info about traditional vs appointed and alternative LSCs to the directory; can be joined with the others based on School ID
